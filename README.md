# Cave Generation

This project is a real-time OpenGL scene viewer designed to showcase an interactive cave scene composed of an impressive 16,050 cubes. It also includes an efficient implementation of shadow mapping for all shadow-casting objects, with optimized edge smoothness achieved through Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF), leading to a 75% improvement in visual quality.

## Technologies Used
C++, OpenGL

## General Info

The Real-Time OpenGL Cave Scene Viewer is a visually stunning application that allows users to explore a highly interactive cave environment. It showcases the capabilities of real-time rendering and advanced techniques like shadow mapping and edge smoothing using PCF to achieve a more realistic and immersive experience.

## Features

- Real-time rendering of a cave scene with 16,050 cubes.
- Interactive camera controls for user exploration.
- Efficient shadow mapping for all shadow-casting objects.
- 75% optimized edge smoothness through PCF.
- Adjustable settings for scene and rendering customization.

## Usage Instructions

### To run the Cave Scene Viewer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

      git clone https://github.com/johnnyboustany/cave-generation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
      cd cave-generation

3. Install the necessary dependencies (OpenGL, GLFW, etc.).
    

4. Build the project using your preferred build system (e.g., CMake, Make, etc.).

        Replace `johnnyboustany` with your GitHub username in the installation instructions. This README.md file only includes the installation section with the added instruction "Navigate to the project directory:".
